The first recorded 'NEI+PTER' value on January 1, 1994 was 10.9749 and then on April 1 of that same year the value was 10.6306 reflecting a change of approximately -0.3443. The negative change reflects a decrease in unemployment (an increase in employment). A positive difference would reflect an increase in unemployment (a decrease in employment).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you can't study the amount of change in isolation because a small change during a period of high unemployment could seem dramatic when it really isn't. So, it is better to consider a relative change which is defined as:\n",

    "$$\\text{relative change} = \\frac{\\text{new value} - \\text{old value}}{\\text{old value}}$$\n",

Without context, it is difficult to understand if -0.0314 is a common negative value or if it is a significantly large negative value. Later in the course, you will learn how to address this concern more systematically. For now, you will just look for the largest negative relative changes in the data as you complete the next few tasks."
